## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Design Principles

#### Visual Hierarchy and Information Architecture
The interface must maintain clear visual hierarchy that guides users naturally through the interaction flow. The most important elements—the chat window, microphone button, and text input—should be prominently positioned and easily accessible. Secondary elements such as status indicators and settings should be visible but not distracting from the primary interaction.

The overall layout should feel spacious and uncluttered, with generous use of negative space to enhance the futuristic aesthetic. The 300x400 pixel chat window should be positioned at the bottom center of the screen, providing easy access while allowing the background video to remain the focal point of the page.

#### Color Psychology and Aesthetic Consistency
The color palette must evoke the high-tech, sophisticated atmosphere of the Iron Man universe while ensuring excellent readability and accessibility. The primary blue-cyan color scheme should be complemented by subtle accent colors that enhance usability without overwhelming the holographic theme.

All interactive elements should provide clear visual feedback through color changes, animations, or other visual cues. The transparency effects must be carefully balanced to maintain readability while achieving the desired holographic appearance.

### Interaction Design

#### Voice Interaction Flow
The voice interaction process must feel natural and intuitive, with clear entry and exit points for voice conversations. Users should be able to easily understand when the system is listening, processing, or responding. The microphone button should provide immediate visual feedback when activated, and the system should gracefully handle interruptions or changes in user intent.

#### Text Interaction Flow
The text-based interaction should complement rather than compete with the voice interface. Users should be able to seamlessly switch between voice and text input methods within the same conversation. The text input field should support standard keyboard shortcuts and provide appropriate placeholder text to guide user interaction.

#### Error State Management
When errors occur, the interface must provide clear, actionable feedback that helps users understand what went wrong and how to resolve the issue. Error messages should be displayed in a way that maintains the aesthetic consistency of the interface while ensuring they are easily readable and understandable.

### Accessibility Requirements

#### Screen Reader Compatibility
The application must be fully compatible with screen readers and other assistive technologies. All interactive elements must have appropriate ARIA labels, and the conversation flow must be navigable using keyboard-only input. Alternative text descriptions must be provided for all visual elements that convey important information.

#### Keyboard Navigation
Complete keyboard navigation support must be implemented, allowing users to access all functionality without requiring mouse or touch input. Tab order should be logical and intuitive, and keyboard shortcuts should be provided for common actions such as activating the microphone or sending text messages.

#### Visual Accessibility
The interface must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for color contrast and visual accessibility. Text must remain readable against the transparent background elements, and important information should not be conveyed through color alone. Users should be able to adjust text size and contrast settings if needed.

## Technical Architecture

### System Architecture Overview

The application follows a modern, component-based architecture that separates concerns effectively while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements. The frontend application is built as a static site that can be deployed to any web hosting platform, with all dynamic functionality provided through client-side JavaScript and external API integrations.

The architecture emphasizes modularity and reusability, with clear separation between presentation components, business logic, and external service integrations. This approach ensures that individual components can be tested, modified, or replaced without affecting the entire system.

### Component Architecture

#### Core Components Structure
The application will be organized into several key component categories, each serving specific purposes within the overall system. Presentation components will handle the visual rendering and user interface elements, while container components will manage state and business logic. Utility components will provide shared functionality that can be reused across different parts of the application.

The chat interface will be implemented as a composite component that combines message display, input handling, and status indication functionality. This component will be designed to be self-contained while providing clear interfaces for integration with the voice processing system.

#### State Management Strategy
Application state will be managed using React's built-in state management capabilities, including useState and useContext hooks for local and shared state respectively. For more complex state interactions, useReducer will be employed to ensure predictable state transitions and easier debugging.

The voice interaction state will be managed separately from the chat interface state, allowing for independent testing and modification of each system. Clear interfaces will be defined between these state management domains to ensure proper data flow and prevent coupling issues.

### Integration Architecture

#### ElevenLabs Integration Pattern
The ElevenLabs ConvAI widget will be integrated using a wrapper component that provides a clean interface between the external widget and the application's internal state management. This wrapper will handle widget lifecycle management, event handling, and error recovery while maintaining the holographic visual theme.

The integration will be implemented in a way that allows for easy testing and development, with mock implementations available for scenarios where the actual ElevenLabs service is not available or appropriate for testing purposes.

#### Asset Management and Optimization
All static assets, including the Iron Man background video, will be optimized for web delivery and properly integrated into the Next.js build process. The video asset will be processed to ensure optimal file size while maintaining visual quality, and appropriate fallback images will be provided for scenarios where video playback is not supported.

CSS and JavaScript assets will be automatically optimized through the Next.js build process, with code splitting and lazy loading implemented where appropriate to minimize initial bundle size and improve loading performance.

## Implementation Specifications

### Development Environment Setup

#### Required Tools and Dependencies
The development environment must include Node.js version 18 or later, with npm or yarn package manager for dependency management. TypeScript compiler and related tooling must be configured to provide real-time type checking and error detection during development.

ESLint and Prettier must be configured to enforce consistent code style and catch potential issues early in the development process. These tools should be integrated into the development workflow through pre-commit hooks and continuous integration processes.

#### Project Structure Organization
The project will follow Next.js conventions for file organization while implementing additional structure for component organization and asset management. Source code will be organized into logical directories that reflect the application's architecture and make it easy for developers to locate and modify specific functionality.

Configuration files will be properly organized and documented to ensure that the development environment can be easily replicated across different machines and deployment scenarios.

### Coding Standards and Best Practices

#### TypeScript Implementation Guidelines
All code must be written in TypeScript with strict type checking enabled. Interface definitions must be created for all data structures, component props, and external API interactions. Generic types should be used appropriately to ensure type safety while maintaining code reusability.

Type definitions should be organized into separate files when they are shared across multiple components or modules. Complex types should be well-documented with comments explaining their purpose and usage patterns.

#### React Component Development Standards
All React components must be implemented as functional components using hooks for state management and side effects. Components should follow the single responsibility principle, with each component having a clear, well-defined purpose. Props should be properly typed and validated, with default values provided where appropriate.

Component files should include comprehensive documentation explaining the component's purpose, props, and usage examples. Complex components should be broken down into smaller, more manageable sub-components that can be tested and maintained independently.

#### CSS and Styling Guidelines
Styling should primarily use Tailwind CSS utility classes, with custom CSS reserved for effects that cannot be achieved through utilities alone. Custom CSS should be organized using CSS modules or styled-components to prevent global namespace pollution and ensure proper scoping.

All custom animations and visual effects should be implemented using CSS transforms and transitions rather than JavaScript-based animation libraries, ensuring optimal performance and smooth visual transitions.

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Testing Approach
All components and utility functions must have comprehensive unit tests written using Jest and React Testing Library. Tests should cover both happy path scenarios and edge cases, with particular attention to error handling and boundary conditions.

Mock implementations should be created for external dependencies, including the ElevenLabs widget, to ensure that tests can run reliably in isolation. Test coverage should be maintained at a minimum of 80% for all critical functionality.

#### Integration Testing Strategy
Integration tests will be implemented using Playwright or Cypress to verify that the application works correctly when all components are combined. These tests will focus on user workflows and cross-component interactions rather than individual component functionality.

Special attention will be paid to testing the integration between the chat interface and the voice processing system, ensuring that state changes are properly synchronized and error conditions are handled gracefully.

#### Manual Testing Procedures
Comprehensive manual testing procedures will be documented for scenarios that cannot be easily automated, particularly voice interaction testing. These procedures will include test cases for different browsers, devices, and network conditions.

Accessibility testing will be performed using both automated tools and manual testing with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation to ensure compliance with accessibility standards.
